## Development Guidelines

**Coding Standards:**

*   Follow the Airbnb JavaScript style guide for uniformity.
*   Use TypeScript for type safety.

**Component Organization:**

*   Organize components by functionality. Components should be reusable and stored in shared directories if applicable.

## Cursor IDE Integration

**Setup Instructions:**

1.  Clone the repository from the version control system.
2.  Install dependencies for both frontend and backend using `npm install` and `pip install` respectively.
3.  Configure environment variables as per the `/config` documentation.
4.  Run backend service using FastAPI and frontend using a Next.js server.

**Key Commands:**

*   `npm run dev` for starting the Next.js development server.
*   `uvicorn main:app --reload` for starting the FastAPI server.

## Additional Context

**User Roles:**

*   Admin: Full access to all functionalities.
*   Trader: Can create and manage bots and strategies.
*   Viewer: Can view strategies and performance dashboards.

**Accessibility Considerations:**

*   Ensure all interactive elements have accessible labels and can be navigated using a keyboard.
*   Implement color contrast standards for users with visual impairments.

## Expert Rules for API Development

**Key Principles:**

*   Write concise, technical responses with accurate Python examples.
*   Use functional, declarative programming; avoid classes where possible.
*   Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
*   Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., is_active, has_permission).
*   Use lowercase with underscores for directories and files (e.g., routers/user_routes.py).
*   Favor named exports for routes and utility functions.
*   Use the Receive an Object, Return an Object (RORO) pattern.

**Python/FastAPI**

*   Use `def` for pure functions and `async def` for asynchronous operations.
*   Use type hints for all function signatures. Prefer Pydantic models over raw dictionaries for input validation.
*   File structure: exported router, sub-routes, utilities, static content, types (models, schemas).
*   Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditional statements.
*   For single-line statements in conditionals, omit curly braces.
*   Use concise, one-line syntax for simple conditional statements (e.g., `if condition: do_something()`).

**Error Handling and Validation**

*   Prioritize error handling and edge cases:

    *   Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
    *   Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
    *   Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
    *   Avoid unnecessary else statements; use the if-return pattern instead.
    *   Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
    *   Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
    *   Use custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.

**Dependencies**

*   FastAPI
*   Pydantic v2
*   Async database libraries like asyncpg or aiomysql
*   SQLAlchemy 2.0 (if using ORM features)

**FastAPI-Specific Guidelines**

*   Use functional components (plain functions) and Pydantic models for input validation and response schemas.
*   Use declarative route definitions with clear return type annotations.
*   Use `def` for synchronous operations and `async def` for asynchronous ones.
*   Minimize `@app.on_event("startup")` and `@app.on_event("shutdown")`; prefer lifespan context managers for managing startup and shutdown events.
*   Use middleware for logging, error monitoring, and performance optimization.
*   Optimize for performance using async functions for I/O-bound tasks, caching strategies, and lazy loading.
*   Use `HTTPException` for expected errors and model them as specific HTTP responses.
*   Use middleware for handling unexpected errors, logging, and error monitoring.
*   Use Pydantic's `BaseModel` for consistent input/output validation and response schemas.

**Performance Optimization**

*   Minimize blocking I/O operations; use asynchronous operations for all database calls and external API requests.
*   Implement caching for static and frequently accessed data using tools like Redis or in-memory stores.
*   Optimize data serialization and deserialization with Pydantic.
*   Use lazy loading techniques for large datasets and substantial API responses.

**Key Conventions**

1.  Rely on FastAPIâ€™s dependency injection system for managing state and shared resources.

2.  Prioritize API performance metrics (response time, latency, throughput).

3.  Limit blocking operations in routes:

    *   Favor asynchronous and non-blocking flows.
    *   Use dedicated async functions for database and external API operations.
    *   Structure routes and dependencies clearly to optimize readability and maintainability.

Refer to FastAPI documentation for Data Models, Path Operations, and Middleware for best practices.
