# Data Download Verification Design Document

## Current Context

- The system uses Freqtrade to download market data through Docker containers
- Data is downloaded to ft_userdata/\_common_data in .feather format
- Current implementation lacks robust verification of download success
- Error handling exists but needs enhancement for verification

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- Verify Docker command execution status
- Validate downloaded data files existence
- Check data file format and content integrity
- Handle and report various failure scenarios
- Support different timeframes and date ranges

### Non-Functional Requirements

- Fast verification process (< 1s)
- Clear error reporting
- No impact on existing download performance
- Maintainable error handling structure
- Use pydantic models for verification results
- Place this logic in ft/verification folder

## Design Decisions

### 1. Verification Approach

Will implement a multi-step verification because:

- Allows separate checking of Docker execution and file system state
- Enables detailed error reporting
- Makes testing easier with clear separation of concerns

### 2. Error Handling Strategy

Will implement hierarchical error types because:

- Different error types need different handling (Docker vs File System vs Data Integrity)
- Helps with error reporting and logging
- Makes it easier to add new error types in the future

## Technical Design

### 1. Core Components

```python
class DataDownloadVerifier:
    """Verifies market data download success"""

    def verify_docker_execution(self, docker_result: dict) -> bool:
        """Verifies Docker command execution success"""
        pass

    def verify_files_existence(self, expected_files: List[str]) -> bool:
        """Verifies downloaded files exist"""
        pass

    def verify_data_integrity(self, file_path: str) -> bool:
        """Verifies data file integrity"""
        pass

class DownloadVerificationError(Exception):
    """Base class for download verification errors"""
    pass

class DockerExecutionError(DownloadVerificationError):
    """Docker execution specific errors"""
    pass

class FileVerificationError(DownloadVerificationError):
    """File verification specific errors"""
    pass
```

### 2. Data Models

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from datetime import datetime
from typing import List

@dataclass
class VerificationResult:
    """Result of verification process"""
    success: bool
    error_type: Optional[str]
    error_message: Optional[str]
    verified_files: List[str]
    verification_time: datetime
```

### 3. Integration Points

- Integrates with FTMarketData class in ft_market_data.py
- Uses Docker output from FTBase.run_docker_command
- Accesses file system through pathlib
- Reports errors through existing logging system

## Implementation Plan

1. Phase 1: Basic Verification

   - Implement Docker execution verification
   - Add file existence checks
   - Basic error handling
   - Timeline: 2 days

2. Phase 2: Enhanced Verification

   - Implement data integrity checks
   - Add detailed error reporting
   - Enhance logging
   - Timeline: 3 days

3. Phase 3: Testing and Integration

   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - Documentation
   - Timeline: 2 days

## Observability

### Logging

- ERROR: Docker execution failures
- ERROR: File verification failures
- INFO: Successful verifications
- DEBUG: Detailed verification steps

```python
# Logging format
{
    "timestamp": "ISO8601",
    "level": "ERROR/INFO/DEBUG",
    "component": "DataDownloadVerifier",
    "event": "verification_failed/succeeded",
    "details": {
        "error_type": "docker/file/integrity",
        "message": "detailed message"
    }
}
```

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements

- Parallel file verification for large downloads
- Automatic retry mechanism for failed downloads
- Data consistency checks across different timeframes
- Support for different file formats

### Known Limitations

- No verification of data quality (only format and existence)
- Sequential verification process
- Limited to .feather format initially

## Dependencies

### Runtime Dependencies

- python-on-whales
- pandas (for .feather files)
- pathlib
- typing

### Development Dependencies

- pytest
- pytest-asyncio
- mypy

## Security Considerations

- File system access permissions
- Docker command injection prevention
- Error message information disclosure
