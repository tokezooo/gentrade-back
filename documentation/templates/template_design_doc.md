# [Feature/Component Name] Design Document

## Current Context

- Brief overview of the existing system
- Key components and their relationships
- Pain points or gaps being addressed

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- List of must-have functionality
- Expected behaviors
- Integration points

### Non-Functional Requirements

- Performance expectations
- Scalability needs
- Observability requirements
- Security considerations

## Design Decisions

### 1. [Major Decision Area]

Will implement/choose [approach] because:

- Rationale 1
- Rationale 2
- Trade-offs considered

### 2. [Another Decision Area]

Will implement/choose [approach] because:

- Rationale 1
- Rationale 2
- Alternatives considered

## Technical Design

### 1. Core Components

```python
# Key interfaces/classes with type hints
class MainComponent:
    """Core documentation"""
    pass
```

### 2. Data Models

```python
# Key data models with type hints
class DataModel:
    """Model documentation"""
    pass
```

### 3. Integration Points

- How this interfaces with other systems (e.g., Freqtrade, Celery, etc.)
- How this integrates with routes, services, repositories, existing models
- Do we need a new repository, service, route, or model?
- API contracts
- Data flow diagrams if needed

## Implementation Plan

1. Phase 1: [Initial Implementation]

   - Task 1
   - Task 2

2. Phase 2: [Enhancement Phase]

   - Task 1
   - Task 2

3. Phase 3: [Production Readiness]
   - Task 1
   - Task 2

## Observability

### Logging

- Key logging points
- Log levels
- Structured logging format

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements

- Future feature ideas
- Scalability improvements
- Performance optimizations

### Known Limitations

- Current constraints
- Technical debt
- Areas needing future attention

## Dependencies

### Runtime Dependencies

- Required libraries
- External services
- Version constraints

### Development Dependencies

- Build tools
- Development utilities

## Security Considerations

- Authentication/Authorization
- Data protection
- Compliance requirements

## Rollout Strategy

1. Development phase
2. Staging deployment
3. Production deployment
4. Monitoring period
